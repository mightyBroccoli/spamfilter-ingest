Subject: XMPP spam report for {domain} / {ips}

XMPP domain: {domain}
Server:      {srv}
Jabber IP:   {ips}

Hi,

the above mentioned server is used as an open relay to send vast amounts
of XMPP spam to different unrelated servers, such as the server I
administer.

Spammers use the In-Band-Registration feature on that server to
create a large number of accounts, used to send mass messages to my
users.

Please contact the server owner to disable In-Band-Registration, take
measures against spam relaying or to shut down the XMPP service.

Additionally you find a list of the bot accounts and an excerpt of
the spam messages sent to my service attached to this message.

Kind regards,
